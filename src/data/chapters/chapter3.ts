        { kind: 'prose', markdown: `**Problem B — ∫₀^(π/6) sec(x) dx**

**Solution:** We need \`∫ sec x dx\`. Start from trig derivatives. We only need to remember:
\`\`\`
d/dx(sin x) = cos x    and    d/dx(cos x) = -sin x
\`\`\`

All others follow from the product or quotient rule:
\`\`\`
d/dx(sec x) = d/dx(1/cos x) = sin x / cos²x = sec x · tan x

d/dx(tan x) = d/dx(sin x / cos x) = (cos²x + sin²x)/cos²x = sec²x

d/dx(sec x + tan x) = sec x · tan x + sec²x = sec x · (tan x + sec x)
\`\`\`

Since \`(sec x + tan x)\` appears in the derivative of \`(sec x + tan x)\`, we have:
\`\`\`
d/dx [ln|sec x + tan x|] = sec x · (sec x + tan x) / (sec x + tan x) = sec x
\`\`\`

Therefore: \`∫ sec x dx = ln|sec x + tan x| + c\`

For the definite integral:
\`\`\`
∫₀^(π/6) sec x dx = ln(sec(π/6) + tan(π/6)) - ln(sec(0) + tan(0))
\`\`\`

Computing the trig values:
\`\`\`
sec(π/6) = 1/cos(π/6) = 1/(√3/2) = 2/√3
tan(π/6) = sin(π/6)/cos(π/6) = (1/2)/(√3/2) = 1/√3

sec(π/6) + tan(π/6) = 2/√3 + 1/√3 = 3/√3 = √3

sec(0) + tan(0) = 1 + 0 = 1

**Result:**
\`\`\`
∫₀^(π/6) sec x dx = ln(√3) - ln(1) = ln(√3)

\`\`\`
Cylinder 1 (axis along x): y² + z² ≤ 1
Cylinder 2 (axis along y): x² + z² ≤ 1
\`\`\`

The general volume formula is \`V = ∫ A(z) dz\` where \`A(z)\` is the cross-sectional area cut by a horizontal plane at height \`z\`.

**Finding A(z):** At height \`z\`, the cross-section must satisfy both constraints:
- From cylinder 1: \`|y| ≤ √(1 - z²)\`
- From cylinder 2: \`|x| ≤ √(1 - z²)\`

This is a **square** with side length \`2√(1 - z²)\`, so:
\`\`\`
A(z) = (2√(1 - z²))² = 4(1 - z²)
\`\`\`

**Computing the volume** (using symmetry about \`z = 0\`):

**Result: \`V = 16/3\`**

**Alternative approach (inscribed sphere):**

A sphere of radius \`r = 1\` (same as the cylinders) fits inside both cylinders and is therefore inscribed in their intersection. Its volume is \`V_sphere = (4/3)π\`.

At every height \`z\`, the sphere's circular cross-section (area \`π(1-z²)\`) is inscribed in the intersection's square cross-section (area \`4(1-z²)\`). The ratio is constant:
\`\`\`
A_circle / A_square = π(1-z²) / 4(1-z²) = π/4    for all z
\`\`\`

Since this ratio is constant for every z-slice:

V_sphere / V_intersection = π/4  →  V_intersection = (4/π) × V_sphere = (4/π) × (4π/3) = 16/3  ✓

            setup: `Snow began falling at a constant rate some time before noon. At noon, a snow plow began clearing a road, removing a constant volume of snow per unit time. At 1 pm it had moved 2 miles; at 2 pm, 3 miles. When did the snow begin to fall?`,
            solution: `Let \`t = 0\` denote noon and let \`T\` be the number of hours before noon when snow began falling. Define:
- \`c₁\` = volume of snow the plow removes per hour (constant)
- \`c₂\` = rate of cross-sectional area increase per hour (constant snowfall rate)
- \`A(t) = c₂(t + T)\` = cross-sectional area of snow at time \`t\` after noon

The plow's speed is inversely proportional to the snow depth it must clear:
\`\`\`
v(t) = c₁ / A(t) = c₁ / [c₂(t + T)] = c / (t + T)    where c = c₁/c₂
\`\`\`

Distance traveled from \`t = 0\` to \`t = t₁\`:
\`\`\`
∫₀^(t₁) c/(t + T) dt = c · ln((t₁ + T)/T)
\`\`\`

Applying the given conditions:
\`\`\`
c · ln((1 + T)/T) = 2    ...(1)
c · ln((2 + T)/T) = 3    ...(2)
\`\`\`

Dividing equation (2) by equation (1):
\`\`\`
ln((2 + T)/T) / ln((1 + T)/T) = 3/2
\`\`\`

Let \`k = e^(1/c)\`. Then from equations (1) and (2):
\`\`\`
(1 + T)/T = k²    →    1/T = k² - 1
(2 + T)/T = k³    →    1/T = k³ - k²
\`\`\`

Setting these equal:
\`\`\`
k³ - k² = k² - 1  →  k³ - 2k² + 1 = 0  →  (k-1)(k² - k - 1) = 0
\`\`\`

Since \`k = e^(1/c) > 1\` (strictly), we discard \`k = 1\`. The remaining factor gives:
\`\`\`
k² - k - 1 = 0  →  k = (1 + √5)/2    (taking the positive root)
\`\`\`

This is the **golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618**. Since \`T = 1/(k² - 1) = 1/k\` (using \`k² = k + 1\`):
\`\`\`
T = 1/k = 2/(1 + √5) = (√5 - 1)/2 ≈ 0.618 hours ≈ 37 minutes
\`\`\`

**The snow began to fall approximately (√5−1)/2 hours ≈ 37 minutes before noon.**

**Solution:**

Recall that the pdf of \`N(0,1)\` is \`f(x) = (1/√(2π)) e^(-x²/2)\`, and by definition \`∫₋∞^∞ f(x)dx = 1\`, so \`∫₋∞^∞ e^(-x²/2)dx = √(2π)\`. Here is the proof using polar integrals:

Let \`I = ∫₋∞^∞ e^(-x²/2) dx\`. Then:
\`\`\`
I² = (∫₋∞^∞ e^(-x²/2) dx)(∫₋∞^∞ e^(-y²/2) dy) = ∬_ℝ² e^(-(x²+y²)/2) dx dy
\`\`\`

Convert to polar coordinates \`(x² + y² = r², dx dy = r dr dθ)\`:
\`\`\`
I² = ∫₀^(2π) ∫₀^∞ e^(-r²/2) · r dr dθ = 2π · ∫₀^∞ r e^(-r²/2) dr
\`\`\`

Evaluate using the substitution \`u = -r²/2\`, \`du = -r dr\`:
\`\`\`
∫₀^∞ r e^(-r²/2) dr = [-e^(-r²/2)]₀^∞ = 0 - (-1) = 1
\`\`\`

Therefore: \`I² = 2π · 1 = 2π\`, so **\`I = ∫₋∞^∞ e^(-x²/2) dx = √(2π)\`**.

**Solution:**

First, prove **Euler's formula** \`e^(iθ) = cos θ + i sin θ\` using Taylor series:
\`\`\`
e^(iθ) = 1 + (iθ)/1! + (iθ)²/2! + (iθ)³/3! + (iθ)⁴/4! + (iθ)⁵/5! + ...

sin θ = θ - θ³/3! + θ⁵/5! - ...    →    i sin θ = iθ - iθ³/3! + iθ⁵/5! - ...

Combining the real and imaginary parts: **\`e^(iθ) = cos θ + i sin θ\`** ✓

**Special values:**
- \`θ = π\`: \`e^(iπ) = cos π + i sin π = -1\` → **Euler's identity: \`e^(iπ) + 1 = 0\`**
- \`θ = π/2\`: \`e^(iπ/2) = cos(π/2) + i sin(π/2) = i\`

**Computing i^i:**

Since \`e^(iπ/2) = i\`, we have \`ln i = iπ/2\`. Therefore:

i^i = e^(i · ln i) = e^(i · iπ/2) = e^(i²π/2) = e^(-π/2) ≈ 0.2079

Newton's method (also known as the Newton-Raphson method) is an iterative process for solving \`f(x) = 0\`. Starting from an initial guess \`x₀\`:

**Convergence:** When Newton's method converges, the convergence rate is **quadratic**:
\`\`\`
|x_{n+1} - x*| / |xₙ - x*|² < C < 1    where x* is the true root

Applying one Newton iteration:
\`\`\`
x₁ = x₀ - f(x₀)/f'(x₀) = 6 - (36 - 37)/(2 × 6) = 6 - (-1/12) = 6 + 1/12 ≈ 6.083

            solution: `Besides Newton's method, two important alternatives are the bisection method and the secant method.

**Bisection method:**

Start with two values \`a₀\` and \`b₀\` such that \`f(a₀) < 0\` and \`f(b₀) > 0\` (a sign change bracket). At each step, evaluate the midpoint:
- If \`f((aₙ + bₙ)/2) < 0\`: set \`aₙ₊₁ = (aₙ + bₙ)/2\`, \`bₙ₊₁ = bₙ\`
- If \`f((aₙ + bₙ)/2) > 0\`: set \`aₙ₊₁ = aₙ\`, \`bₙ₊₁ = (aₙ + bₙ)/2\`
- If \`|f((aₙ + bₙ)/2)|\` is within tolerance: stop, \`x* ≈ (aₙ + bₙ)/2\`

The bisection method has **linear convergence**: \`|x_{n+1} - x*| / |xₙ - x*| < δ < 1\`. It is slower than Newton's method, but **convergence is guaranteed** once a valid bracket \`(a₀, b₀)\` is found.

**Secant method:**

Start with two initial values \`x₀\`, \`x₁\` and apply:
\`\`\`
x_{n+1} = xₙ - f(xₙ) · (xₙ - x_{n-1}) / (f(xₙ) - f(x_{n-1}))
\`\`\`

This replaces the exact derivative \`f'(xₙ)\` in Newton's method with a finite-difference approximation. The secant method does not require computing derivatives, making it valuable when \`f'(x)\` is hard to compute.

**Convergence rate: \`(1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618\`** (superlinear — faster than bisection, slower than Newton). Like Newton's method, convergence is not guaranteed for poor initial values.
